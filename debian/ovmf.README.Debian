The OVMF_CODE*.fd files provide UEFI firmware for a QEMU guest that is
intended to be read-only. The OVMF_VARS*.fd files provide UEFI variable
template images which are intended to be read-write, and therefore each
guest should be given its own copy. Here's an overview of each of them:

OVMF_CODE_4M.fd
  Use this for booting guests in non-Secure Boot mode. While this image
  technically supports Secure Boot, it does so without requiring SMM
  support from QEMU, so it is less secure. Use the OVMF_VARS.fd template
  with this.

OVMF_CODE_4M.ms.fd
  This is a symlink to OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd. It is useful in the context
  of libvirt because the included JSON firmware descriptors will tell libvirt
  to pair OVMF_VARS.ms.fd with it, which has Secure Boot pre-enabled.

OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd
  Like OVMF_CODE_4M.fd, but will abort if QEMU does not support SMM.
  Use this for guests for which you may enable Secure Boot. Be aware
  that the included JSON firmware descriptors associate this with
  OVMF_CODE_4M.fd. Which means, if you specify this image in libvirt, you'll
  get a guest that is Secure Boot-*capable*, but has Secure Boot disabled.
  To enable it, you'll need to manually import PK/KEK/DB keys and activate
  Secure Boot from the UEFI setup menu. If you want Secure Boot active from
  the start, consider using OVMF_CODE.ms.fd instead.

OVMF_VARS_4M.fd
  This is an empty variable store template, which means it has no
  built-in Secure Boot keys and Secure Boot is disabled. You can use
  it with any OVMF_CODE image, but keep in mind that if you want to
  boot in Secure Boot mode, you will have to enable it manually.

OVMF_VARS_4M.ms.fd
  This template has distribution-specific PK and KEK1 keys, and
  the default Microsoft keys in KEK/DB. It also has Secure Boot
  already activated. Using this with OVMF_CODE.ms.fd will boot a
  guest directly in Secure Boot mode.

OVMF.fd
  This is a unified image that includes the contents of both
  OVMF_CODE.fd and OVMF_VARS.fd. It is provided as a convenience for
  testing purposes, as it can be easily booted by QEMU using the -bios
  option. It should not be used for production VMs. If VMs need to
  update their variables, they need to have their own writeable copy
  of this image. Making such a copy divorces the OVMF_CODE content in
  those images from the code provided by the ovmf package, and they
  will therefore not automatically benefit from updates made to the
  ovmf package, as would be the case for VMs that use the system
  OVMF_CODE.fd image and their own writeable OVMF_VARS.fd image. New
  unified images are not being provided for additional variants
  (secboot, etc).

OVMF_CODE_4M.snakeoil.fd
OVMF_VARS_4M.snakeoil.fd
  This image is **for testing purposes only**. It includes an insecure
  "snakeoil" key in PK, KEK & DB. The private key and cert are also
  shipped in this package as well, so that testers can easily sign
  binaries that will be considered valid.

PkKek-1-snakeoil.key
PkKek-1-snakeoil.pem
  The private key and certificate for the snakeoil key. Use these
  to sign binaries that can be verified by the key in the
  OVMF_VARS.snakeoil.fd template. The password for the key is
  'snakeoil'.
